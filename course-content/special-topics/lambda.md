# AWS Lambda (Python)

A reference for building and deploying AWS Lambda functions in Python. No prior Lambda experience required.

## What Is AWS Lambda?

**AWS Lambda** is a **serverless** compute service: you upload code (e.g. Python), and AWS runs it when triggered—by a schedule, an HTTP request, or other events. You do not manage servers; you only write the function and configure when it runs.

- **Pay per use:** You are charged for the number of invocations and the execution time (per 100 ms).
- **Scalable:** AWS runs as many copies of your function as needed to handle the load.
- **Stateless:** Each invocation gets a clean environment. Use environment variables or external storage (e.g. S3) for configuration and data.

Lambda can run on demand (e.g. when you click “Test” in the console), on a schedule, or in response to events from other AWS services.

## Lambda Function Basics

### Handler (entry point)

Lambda runs a single function you define. For Python, you specify the **handler** as:

```text
filename.function_name
```

Example: if your file is `lambda_function.py` and your function is `lambda_handler`, the handler is:

```text
lambda_function.lambda_handler
```

### Handler signature (Python)

Your function must accept two arguments and can return a value (e.g. a dict that Lambda can convert to JSON):

```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # event: data passed to the invocation (e.g. test event payload)
    # context: runtime info (request_id, remaining time, etc.)
    # Your logic here
    return {"statusCode": 200, "body": "Success"}
```

You can ignore `event` and `context` if the function is only triggered with an empty or fixed payload; use them when input is passed via the event.

### Runtime

Choose **Python 3.9** or **Python 3.10** (or newer). Set the runtime when creating the function in the AWS Console.

---

## Creating a Lambda Function in the AWS Console

1. In **AWS Console**, go to **Services → Lambda**.
2. Click **Create function**.
3. Choose **Author from scratch**.
4. **Function name:** e.g. `my-function`.
5. **Runtime:** Python 3.9 (or 3.10).
6. **Execution role:** Select the existing IAM role **`LabRole`** (provided for this course). It already includes permissions for **CloudWatch Logs**, **S3**, and other services you need for course projects. Do not create a new role unless your instructor tells you otherwise.
7. Click **Create function**.

You will then see the **Code** tab where you can paste or upload your code.

---

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are the right place for configuration: API keys, bucket names, limits, and other settings. They keep secrets and config out of your code.

### Setting environment variables in the console

1. Open your Lambda function.
2. Go to the **Configuration** tab.
3. In the left sidebar, click **Environment variables**.
4. Click **Edit** → **Add environment variable** for each setting (e.g. `API_KEY`, `BUCKET_NAME`).
5. **Save** the configuration.

**Security:** Do not put API keys or secrets in your code or in screenshots. Use environment variables and mask sensitive values in any documentation or screenshots.

### Reading environment variables in Python

Use the `os` module:

```python
import os

api_key = os.environ.get("API_KEY")
bucket_name = os.environ.get("BUCKET_NAME")
```

- `os.environ.get("KEY")` returns `None` if the variable is not set.
- `os.environ.get("KEY", "default")` returns `"default"` when the variable is missing.
- All values are strings. Convert where needed (e.g. `int(...)` for numeric config).
- Validate and handle missing or invalid values: raise clear errors or log and return an error response so the function fails in a controlled way.

## Scheduling Lambda with EventBridge

You can run a Lambda function on a schedule (e.g. every hour, daily) using **Amazon EventBridge** (formerly CloudWatch Events). EventBridge invokes your function at the specified times; your code does not need to change—it is simply triggered with an event payload (often empty or a fixed structure) each time the schedule fires.

### Why EventBridge?

- **Decoupled:** The schedule is configured outside your code. You can enable, disable, or change the schedule without redeploying the function.
- **Flexible:** Supports both simple intervals (`rate`) and cron-style schedules.
- **Visible:** In the Lambda console, the trigger appears under **Configuration → Triggers**, so you can confirm the function runs on a schedule.

### Adding a schedule trigger in the AWS Console

1. Open your Lambda function in the **AWS Console**.
2. Go to the **Configuration** tab.
3. In the left sidebar, click **Triggers** (or **Add trigger** if you have none).
4. Click **Add trigger**.
5. **Source:** Choose **EventBridge (CloudWatch Events)**.
6. **Rule:** Either create a new rule or select an existing one.
   - **Create a new rule:** Give it a name (e.g. `hourly-invocation`).
   - **Rule type:** Select **Schedule expression**.
   - **Schedule expression:** Use one of the formats below.
7. Leave **Enable trigger** checked.
8. Click **Add**.

Your Lambda will now be invoked automatically according to the schedule. You can see the trigger listed under **Configuration → Triggers**.

### Schedule expression formats

**Rate expression** – run at a fixed interval:

| Expression        | Meaning                    |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| `rate(1 minute)`  | Every 1 minute             |
| `rate(5 minutes)` | Every 5 minutes            |
| `rate(1 hour)`    | Every 1 hour               |
| `rate(1 day)`     | Every 24 hours             |

- Use singular: `minute`, `hour`, `day` (not `minutes`, `hours`, `days`).
- Minimum interval is 1 minute.

**Cron expression** – run at specific times (UTC):

| Expression              | Meaning                          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `cron(0 * * * ? *)`     | Every hour at minute 0           |
| `cron(0 12 * * ? *)`    | Every day at 12:00 UTC           |
| `cron(0 9 ? * MON-FRI *)` | Weekdays at 09:00 UTC         |

Format: `cron(minutes hours day-of-month month day-of-week year)`. Use `?` for “any” where both day-of-month and day-of-week are not needed.

### Verifying the trigger

- **Configuration → Triggers:** You should see **EventBridge (CloudWatch Events)** with your rule name and schedule expression.
- **Monitoring → Logs:** After the schedule fires, new invocations will appear in CloudWatch Logs; you can confirm the function ran at the expected time.

Your handler can ignore the `event` and `context` arguments if the schedule does not pass custom payload; the function will still run on every scheduled invocation.

## Packaging Your Lambda (Python + Dependencies)

Lambda runs your code in a fixed environment. The runtime includes **boto3** (AWS SDK), so you do not need to package it. It does **not** include third-party libraries like **requests**; if your code uses them, you must provide the library (and its dependencies) in a **zip** that Lambda can use.

**On macOS/Linux:**

1. Create a folder for the deployment package:

   ```bash
   mkdir lambda_package
   cd lambda_package
   ```

2. Install the library into this folder:

   ```bash
   pip install requests -t .
   ```

3. Copy your handler file into the same folder:

   ```bash
   cp /path/to/your/lambda_function.py .
   ```

4. Zip the **contents** of the folder (not the folder itself):

   ```bash
   zip -r ../lambda_deploy.zip .
   cd ..
   ```

5. Upload `lambda_deploy.zip` in the Lambda console: **Code** tab → **Upload from** → **.zip file**.

**On Windows (PowerShell or Command Prompt):**

1. Create a folder for the deployment package and go into it:

   ```powershell
   mkdir lambda_package
   cd lambda_package
   ```

2. Install the library into this folder:

   ```powershell
   pip install requests -t .
   ```

3. Copy your handler file into the same folder (adjust the path to your file):

   ```powershell
   copy C:\path\to\your\lambda_function.py .
   ```

4. Zip the **contents** of the folder (not the folder itself). In PowerShell, from inside `lambda_package`:

   ```powershell
   Compress-Archive -Path * -DestinationPath ..\lambda_deploy.zip
   cd ..
   ```

   Or in File Explorer: open `lambda_package`, select **all** files and folders inside it (Ctrl+A), right‑click → **Send to** → **Compressed (zipped) folder**, then name it `lambda_deploy.zip`. The zip must contain your `.py` file and the library folders at the **root** of the archive, not inside a `lambda_package` subfolder.

5. Upload `lambda_deploy.zip` in the Lambda console: **Code** tab → **Upload from** → **.zip file**.

**Important:** Your handler file (e.g. `lambda_function.py`) must be at the **root** of the zip (same level as the library folders). The handler remains `lambda_function.lambda_handler`.

### Zip structure (conceptual)

```text
lambda_deploy.zip
├── lambda_function.py    ← your code
├── requests/
│   └── ...
└── urllib3/
    └── ...
```

## IAM Permissions

The **execution role** attached to your Lambda function must have:

1. **CloudWatch Logs** – so Lambda can write logs (usually attached by default when you create a role from the Lambda console).
2. **Any other services your code uses** – e.g. S3 (`s3:PutObject`, `s3:GetObject`, `s3:GetBucketLocation` on the buckets you use).

Your Lambda function should use the **`LabRole`** execution role. If your code gets “Access Denied” when calling another service, confirm that **`LabRole`** is attached under **Configuration → Permissions**, and that you are using resources (buckets, tables, queues) in the same AWS account and region as your course environment.

---

## Using S3 from Lambda

- **Create a bucket** in the S3 console if you need one. Use the same region as your Lambda when possible.
- **Object key:** Choose a key format that fits your use case (e.g. `prefix/category/timestamp.json` or `data/2026-01-15.json`).
- Use the **boto3** client (already available in the runtime) to upload:

```python
import boto3
import json

s3 = boto3.client("s3")
bucket_name = os.environ.get("BUCKET_NAME")

# Example: store a JSON body under a key
key = "data/example.json"
s3.put_object(
    Bucket=bucket_name,
    Key=key,
    Body=json.dumps(your_data),
    ContentType="application/json"
)
```

Get `bucket_name` (and any key parts) from environment variables or the event. Only write to S3 when your logic has succeeded; do not store failed or invalid results if your requirements say otherwise.

---

## Logging and CloudWatch

- **print()** and the **logging** module both send output to **CloudWatch Logs** for your Lambda function.
- Using **logging** gives you levels and consistent format:

```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# In your code:
logger.info("Processing item %s", item_id)
logger.exception("Request failed: %s", str(e))  # logs stack trace
```

- Catch exceptions, log them with `logger.exception()` or `logger.error()`, then return an error response or re-raise as appropriate. Avoid unhandled exceptions that exit the function without logging.

---

## Exception Handling

Lambda functions should handle errors so that:

- Failures are **logged** with clear messages.
- The function returns a **consistent response shape** (e.g. status and body) instead of crashing with an unhandled exception.

Typical categories to handle:

- **Connection errors** – network failures, unreachable hosts, wrong ports.
- **API or HTTP errors** – non-2xx status codes, timeouts, invalid responses.
- **Invalid or missing environment variables** – missing keys, bad format, wrong types.
- **S3 errors** – permission denied, bucket not found, network issues.
- **JSON or parsing errors** – invalid response format.

Use **try/except** blocks, log every handled exception, and return a structured response (e.g. `{"statusCode": 200, "body": "..."}` on success and `{"statusCode": 500, "body": "..."}` on failure) so you can test and debug from the console and CloudWatch.

---

## Local Testing (Before Uploading)

You can run the same handler on your machine to test success and failure paths:

1. Set environment variables (e.g. in a terminal):

   ```bash
   export API_KEY="your-key"
   export BUCKET_NAME="your-bucket"
   ```

2. Call your handler from a small test script:

   ```python
   from lambda_function import lambda_handler
   result = lambda_handler({}, None)
   print(result)
   ```

3. Test both success and failure cases (e.g. invalid input, missing env vars, or a failing external call) and confirm that exceptions are handled and logged, and that no data is written when it should not be.

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Lambda function created with the correct runtime (e.g. Python 3.9+) and handler (e.g. `lambda_function.lambda_handler`).
- [ ] If the function must run on a schedule: EventBridge trigger added (Configuration → Triggers) with the desired rate or cron expression (e.g. `rate(1 hour)`).
- [ ] Environment variables set in the Configuration tab and read in code with `os.environ.get(...)`; missing or invalid values are validated and handled.
- [ ] Deployment package: if you use third-party libraries (e.g. `requests`), they are included in the zip; boto3 is provided by the runtime.
- [ ] Execution role is **`LabRole`** with permissions for CloudWatch Logs and any other services your code uses (e.g. S3).
- [ ] Exception handling in place for connection errors, API/S3 failures, bad env vars, and parsing errors; all logged; function returns a consistent response shape.
- [ ] Local tests cover both success and failure paths; CloudWatch logs confirm behavior after deployment.
